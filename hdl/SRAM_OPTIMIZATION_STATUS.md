# SRAM Optimization Project - Status

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Baseline Test Suite Ready

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis
- Created `SRAM_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md` with full technical analysis
- Documented current 3-layer architecture (mem_controller ‚Üí sram_proc_new ‚Üí sram_driver_new)
- Analyzed SRAM timing specifications (IS61WV51216BLL-10TLI)
- Identified optimization opportunities (5x speedup possible)
- Documented risks and mitigation strategies

### 2. Baseline Test Suite
- Created `firmware/memory_test_baseline.c` - comprehensive SRAM test program
- Added to Makefile NEWLIB_TARGETS list
- Successfully builds with `make firmware` or `make TARGET=memory_test_baseline USE_NEWLIB=1`
- Binary size: 45KB

### 3. Test Coverage
The baseline test suite includes:

**Functional Tests:**
1. Sequential 32-bit write/read (4KB)
2. Random access patterns
3. Byte-level write/read
4. Halfword (16-bit) write/read
5. Back-to-back transactions
6. Walking bit patterns (walking 1s and 0s)
7. Alternating pattern stress test (100 iterations)
8. Address boundary crossing (64KB, 128KB boundaries)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
9. Sequential read benchmark (1000 words, measures cycles)
10. Sequential write benchmark (1000 words, measures cycles)

### 4. Expected Baseline Performance
Based on analysis:
- **32-bit Read**: ~15 cycles = 300ns @ 50MHz
- **32-bit Write (full)**: ~15 cycles = 300ns @ 50MHz
- **32-bit Write (partial)**: ~29 cycles = 580ns @ 50MHz

## üìã Next Steps (DO NOT PROCEED until baseline tests pass!)

### Phase 2: Run Baseline Tests on Hardware
```bash
cd firmware
make firmware                  # Builds all targets including memory_test_baseline
cd ../tools/uploader
./fw_upload_fast ../../firmware/memory_test_baseline.bin
```

**Requirements**:
- ALL functional tests must PASS (100%)
- Capture benchmark timing numbers
- Document any anomalies

### Phase 3: Design Optimized Controller
Only after Phase 2 is 100% successful:
- Create `hdl/sram_controller_optimized.v`
- Single unified module (merge mem_controller + sram_proc_new + sram_driver_new)
- Target: 3-cycle read/write sequences

### Phase 4: Regression Testing
- Run same baseline tests on optimized implementation
- Must achieve 100% pass rate
- Verify 3-5x performance improvement

### Phase 5: Production Integration
- Add Makefile option: USE_OPTIMIZED_SRAM=1
- Keep both implementations for A/B comparison
- Document performance gains

##  ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Test-First Methodology

**DO NOT** modify any HDL files until baseline tests pass on hardware!

The memory subsystem is the foundation of the entire system. Any bugs will cause:
- Catastrophic system failures
- Very difficult debugging
- Data corruption
- Unpredictable behavior

**Golden Rule**: Establish known-good baseline FIRST, optimize SECOND.

## üéØ Performance Goals

### Current (Baseline)
- Read: 15 cycles (300ns)
- Write: 15 cycles (300ns)
- Partial Write: 29 cycles (580ns)

### Target (Optimized)
- Read: 3 cycles (60ns) - **5x faster**
- Write: 3 cycles (60ns) - **5x faster**
- Partial Write: 7 cycles (140ns) - **4x faster**

### System Impact
- Faster instruction fetch
- Faster data access
- Higher effective CPU performance
- Better overlay loading
- Smoother graphics/ncurses

## üìä Memory Map

```
0x00000000 - 0x0007FFFF   SRAM (512KB)
0x00040000 - 0x00041FFF   Boot ROM (8KB, within SRAM range)
0x80000000 - 0x800000FF   MMIO peripherals
```

Test region: `0x00010000 - 0x00011000` (4KB at 64KB offset, safe)

## üîß Build Instructions

### Build Baseline Test
```bash
cd firmware
make memory_test_baseline    # Requires: make TARGET=memory_test_baseline USE_NEWLIB=1
# OR
make firmware                # Builds all targets including baseline test
```

### Upload to Hardware
```bash
cd tools/uploader
./fw_upload_fast ../../firmware/memory_test_baseline.bin
```

### Expected Output
```
================================================================================
SRAM BASELINE TEST SUITE
================================================================================
...
Tests Passed: 10
Tests Failed: 0

*** ALL TESTS PASSED ***

BASELINE ESTABLISHED - Safe to proceed with optimization
================================================================================
```

1. `hdl/SRAM_OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Technical analysis
2. `hdl/SRAM_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS.md` - This file
3. `firmware/memory_test_baseline.c` - Test suite
4. Modified: `firmware/Makefile` - Added memory_test_baseline to NEWLIB_TARGETS
