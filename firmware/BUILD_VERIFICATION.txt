FreeRTOS Integration Build Verification Report
==============================================

Date: October 19, 2025
Binary: freertos_demo.bin (14,052 bytes)
Target: PicoRV32 RISC-V RV32IM @ 50 MHz

BUILD STATUS: ✅ SUCCESS - All Components Integrated

Memory Layout:
--------------
  Code:  14,052 bytes (13.7 KB)
  Data:      84 bytes
  BSS:   16,976 bytes (16.6 KB) - includes 16KB FreeRTOS heap
  Total: 31,112 bytes (30.4 KB)

FreeRTOS Components Verified:
-----------------------------

1. ✅ Context Switching (IRQ Vector at 0x0010)
   - Saves 16 caller-saved registers to task stack
   - Saves SP to pxCurrentTCB->pxTopOfStack (before irq_handler)
   - Loads SP from pxCurrentTCB->pxTopOfStack (after irq_handler)
   - Restores 16 registers from (possibly new) task stack
   - Uses retirq instruction to return

2. ✅ Timer Tick Generation
   - vPortSetupTimerInterrupt at 0x2cec
   - irq_handler at 0x2d18
   - Timer configured: PSC=49, ARR=999 → 1 KHz (1ms tick)
   - Calls xTaskIncrementTick() and vTaskSwitchContext()

3. ✅ Task Management
   - pxCurrentTCB symbol at 0x795c (BSS section)
   - xTaskCreate at 0x0d6c
   - vTaskDelay at 0x1230
   - vTaskStartScheduler at 0x1988
   - uxTaskGetNumberOfTasks at 0x13e0
   - xTaskGetTickCount at 0x1d2c

4. ✅ All Four Demo Tasks
   - vTask1_FastBlink at 0x014c (500ms LED0 blink)
   - vTask2_MediumBlink at 0x0190 (1000ms LED1 blink)
   - vTask3_SlowBlink at 0x01d4 (2000ms LED2 blink)
   - vTask4_StatusReport at 0x0338 (5s status report)

5. ✅ Task Stack Initialization
   - pxPortInitialiseStack at 0x2c18
   - Allocates 16 registers (64 bytes) per task
   - Sets ra = task entry point
   - Sets a0 = task parameter

6. ✅ Critical Sections
   - vPortEnterCritical at 0x2ca8 (maskirq ~0)
   - vPortExitCritical at 0x2cd0 (maskirq 0)

7. ✅ Memory Management
   - heap_4 allocator linked
   - pvPortMalloc / vPortFree present
   - xPortGetFreeHeapSize at 0x2a8c
   - 16 KB heap configured

8. ✅ Scheduler Functions
   - vTaskSwitchContext at 0x1a2c
   - xTaskIncrementTick at 0x1dd4
   - xPortStartScheduler at 0x2c60

Code Size Breakdown (from .lst analysis):
-----------------------------------------
  Startup code (startFRT.S):     ~200 bytes
  Application tasks (4 tasks):   ~700 bytes
  UART functions:                ~300 bytes
  FreeRTOS kernel:             ~11,000 bytes
  Port layer:                    ~500 bytes
  Newlib syscalls:               ~800 bytes
  Timer/IRQ handling:            ~300 bytes

Verification Tests Passed:
--------------------------
✅ Compiles without errors
✅ Links without undefined symbols
✅ All FreeRTOS kernel functions present in binary
✅ Context switching code integrated into IRQ vector
✅ Timer tick handler overrides weak irq_handler symbol
✅ pxCurrentTCB properly referenced in assembly code
✅ Task stack initialization matches startFRT.S layout
✅ All 4 demo tasks included in binary
✅ Binary size reasonable (~14KB) for functionality

Outstanding Work (Tasks 5-7):
-----------------------------
❌ Task 5: Complete xPortStartScheduler()
   - Currently just initializes timer and enables interrupts
   - NEEDS: Assembly code to load first task's context and jump to it
   - Location: lib/freertos_port/port.c:57-74

❌ Task 6: Hardware Testing
   - Upload to FPGA with: ../tools/uploader/fw_upload_fast freertos_demo.bin
   - Verify tasks actually run and switch
   - Check UART output shows messages from all 4 tasks
   - Verify LED blinking at correct rates

❌ Task 7: Debug and Iterate
   - Fix any runtime issues discovered during hardware test
   - Tune tick rate, stack sizes, priorities if needed
   - Verify no stack overflows or heap exhaustion

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Implement xPortStartScheduler() to jump to first task
2. Upload to hardware and test
3. Debug any issues
4. Only commit after full working verification on hardware

CONCLUSION:
-----------
Build system fully operational. All FreeRTOS components integrated.
Static linking verified. Context switching code in place.
Ready for Task 5 (scheduler startup) implementation.

DO NOT COMMIT until hardware-tested and working!
