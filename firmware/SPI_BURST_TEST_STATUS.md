## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Hardware Off-By-One Bug (FIXED in hdl/spi_master.v)
**Problem**: Burst counter was decremented BEFORE checking if it reached 1, causing firmware hangs.

**Fix Applied**: Check burst_count == 1 BEFORE decrementing:
```verilog
if (burst_count == 13'h1) begin
    burst_mode <= 1'b0;
    burst_count <= 13'h0;
    irq_pulse <= 1'b1;
end else begin
    burst_count <= burst_count - 1'b1;
end
```

**Verification**: ModelSim simulation - 28/29 tests PASSED including critical 512-byte test.

### Issue 2: Loop Counter Type Mismatch (FIXED in sd_spi_optimized.c)
**Problem**: Used `int` instead of `uint16_t` for loop counters, causing lockups even with burst disabled.

**Fix Applied**: Changed to match baseline:
```c
// Read loop (line 328)
for (uint16_t i = 0; i < 512; i++) {
    buffer[i] = spi_transfer(0xFF);
}

// Write loop (line 362)
for (uint16_t i = 0; i < 512; i++) {
    spi_transfer(buffer[i]);
}
```

## Current Configuration

**Burst Mode**: ✅ ENABLED in firmware (using `spi_burst_transfer()` for 512-byte blocks)

**Implementation**:
- `sd_read_block()` (line 328): `spi_burst_transfer(NULL, buffer, 512);`
- `sd_write_block()` (line 360): `spi_burst_transfer(buffer, NULL, 512);`

**Expected Result**: ~2.8x faster SD card performance compared to baseline.

---

## Test Plan

### Step 1: Verify Baseline Works ✅ COMPLETED
```bash
# Upload optimized firmware (burst disabled)
../tools/uploader/fw_upload_fast sd_card_manager_optimized.bin

# Test SD card operations
# Expected: Should mount filesystem and work perfectly (no lockups)
```

**Result**: ✅ PASSED after `make clean` rebuild. Loop counter issue was resolved.

### Step 2: Enable Burst Mode ✅ COMPLETED
Burst mode has been re-enabled in `firmware/sd_fatfs/sd_spi_optimized.c`:

**Changes Made**:
- Line 328: `spi_burst_transfer(NULL, buffer, 512);` - Read 512 bytes
- Line 360: `spi_burst_transfer(buffer, NULL, 512);` - Write 512 bytes

**Build Status**: ✅ Clean rebuild completed at 22:14 CDT

### Step 3: Performance Testing ⏳ READY FOR TESTING
Now ready to measure burst mode performance improvement:
- Expected: ~2.8x faster than baseline
- File read/write benchmarks
- Compare with baseline `sd_card_manager.bin`

## Hardware Verification Summary

### ModelSim Simulation Results
- **Test Suite**: 29 comprehensive tests
- **Pass Rate**: 28/29 (96.6%)
- **Critical Test**: 512-byte burst ✅ PASSED
- **All 512 bytes transferred correctly**
- **No off-by-one errors**
- **Burst mode clears after final byte**

## Files Modified

### HDL Changes
- `hdl/spi_master.v` - Fixed burst counter off-by-one bug

### Firmware Changes
- `firmware/sd_fatfs/sd_spi_optimized.c` - Fixed loop counter types, burst disabled for testing
- `firmware/sd_fatfs/hardware.h` - Added SPI_BURST register definition
- `firmware/sd_fatfs/io.h` - Added spi_burst_transfer() prototype
- `firmware/sd_fatfs/io.c` - Implemented spi_burst_transfer() with timeouts
- `firmware/sd_fatfs/sd_card_manager_optimized.c` - Test application
- `firmware/Makefile` - Added optimized build targets

### Test Files
- `sim/spi_master_tb.v` - Comprehensive testbench
- `sim/compile_spi_master.do` - ModelSim compile script
- `sim/run_spi_master_test.do` - ModelSim run script
- `sim/SPI_MASTER_TEST_REPORT.md` - Full verification report

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Build** (Oct 29 22:11) - Verify baseline works with fixed loop counters
2. **If Successful** - Re-enable burst mode as described in Step 2 above
3. **Performance Testing** - Measure actual throughput improvement
4. **Commit Changes** - Once fully verified on hardware

## Troubleshooting

### If Baseline Still Fails
Compare assembly output:
```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sd_card_manager.elf > baseline.asm
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sd_card_manager_optimized.elf > optimized.asm
diff -u baseline.asm optimized.asm | grep -A20 -B20 "sd_read_block"
```

Look for differences in:
- Loop structure compilation
- Register allocation
- Memory access patterns
