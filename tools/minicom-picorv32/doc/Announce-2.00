		Announcing minicom 2.00

A short summary of what minicom is:

Minicom is a communications program that resembles the MSDOS Telix
somewhat. It has a dialing directory, color, full ANSI and VT100
emulation, an (external) scripting language and more.

Tested platforms:
Linux 2.0.34-2.2.5, Solaris

Supported but untested (may need a little tweaking):
DGUX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Coherent, HP/UX, SysVR4, Apollo Domain/OS, SunOS, SCO.

Some of the main changes after 1.83.1:
- The biggest change is probably the use of autoconf. This is a technical
  change that doesn't affect how the program looks like or how it works,
  but it should help porting to other platforms.
- command line option to default autowrap on
- some more languages supported
- some bugfixes

Unfortunately the Portuguese and Spanish translations are not yet up-to-date, 
but they will become available at http://www.clinet.fi/~walker/minicom.html 
and an updated packet will be sent to ftp://sunsite.unc.edu as soon as I get
an updated version of the files.
